# Encryption-using-HuffmanAlgorithm
Our project is about protecting data using Data encryption.
Data encryption is a method of converting the data into another form so no other people can see your personal data.
And the data can only be accessed by the person with the correct decryption key. Encryption helps to protect sensitive data,
personal information. When data is encrypted even if an unauthorized person gains access to it he will not be able to read it. 
Encryption uses algorithms to convert data. 
There are many algorithms such as RSA, AES. We are using Huffman algorithm (dynamic programming) to encode or decode the data. 

Programming Language  : CSHARP(C#)
