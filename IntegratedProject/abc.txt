Counting Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm that can be used for sorting elements within a specific range. This sorting technique is based on the count of each element to be sorted. This algorithm uses three arrays.
First one is the unsorted input array. This array contains n elements in the range of 0 to k, where n and k are positive integer numbers. These n elements have to be sorted in ascending order using the counting sort technique. Array can have duplicate and distinct elements.
Letâ€™s take the second temporary array as count. This array is used for storing the count of the elements in the array First of all we will initialize this array with zero and then we will store the count of each element at their respective index in the array. Then we will modify the count array. This array will now store previous sum of the elements of the count array. Each element at each index will hold sum of previous counts. It will help in placing the elements into the correct index.
Now we will make third array which is of size of original array. This array will store sorted elements. Now we will traverse the unsorted array from last and find its position from modified count array and place that element in sorted array at that address. After placing each element at its correct position, decrease the its count by one.so that duplicate element will not end up in the same position in sorted array.
This sorting algorithm is very efficient when difference between different keys are not so big, otherwise it can increase the space complexity.
